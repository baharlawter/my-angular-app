    Hi, my name is Bahar, and I created this app to provide users with more information and tools
    about personal finances. I have always been interested in saving money, investing, paying off
    debt, and paying off a house early—these have been my passion topics. Inspired by following Dave
    Ramsey’s style, I built this app to help you better understand your finances.

  <ul>
    <li>A calculator page that calculates your debt-to-income ratio</li>
    <li>A books page where users can purchase financial books through external links</li>
    <li>A blogs page where you can learn more about managing your finances</li>
  </ul>
